# First Milestone
Myt first milestone was that i was working on different related coding in Processing and found different things that would set up my Arduino Pong Game by learing the basics in the coding with processing. So what i did was i had 4 different blocks of code for one of them i would make a layout of the pong game and the second block of code i would show 3 different objects moving so i would know for working on porject on how to do that and then the third block of code i would show one object that is moving faster than the other to show how the different speeds work in the code and then the final block of code shows how you can set a ball to move on one side to the other and seeing how collision works in coding as well

# Second Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Final Milestone
  
My final milestone is that i am hoping to have a final prototype of a game of pong that would work and i could possibly play with it to see if it work. I would have 2 controllers to play the pong game to play with a friend or a family memeber and have a screen that would show the game being played. i see that this would be cool and fun project to do like the constructing with the cables to the Arduino was not to hard and fun to make at the same time.
