# First Milestone
Myt first milestone was that i was working on different related coding in Processing and found different things that would set up my Arduino Pong Game by learing the basics in the coding with processing. So what i did was i had 4 different blocks of code for one of them i would make a layout of the pong game and the second block of code i would show 3 different objects moving so i would know for working on porject on how to do that and then the third block of code i would show one object that is moving faster than the other to show how the different speeds work in the code and then the final block of code shows how you can set a ball to move on one side to the other and seeing how collision works in coding as well

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was i would get my 2 potentiometer set it up with the breadboard on some wiring to connect both of it to my arduino and set it with how much volts and others as well and then get some wires to connect them in the breadboard next to my potentiometer and that would make the controller for the game of pong. In the coding side i would make it in the arduino to set up the potentiometer as the controls for my game of pong and then would on processing set up the things that make a pong game. I would make the  paddle move so for the right one would move the right one and the left would move the left one as well and then added a class for the pong ball and a class for the paddle within the coding so the ball in this demonstration showed it moving and then the paddles moving with the corresponding potentiometer.

# Final Milestone
  
My final milestone is that i am hoping to have a final prototype of a game of pong that would work and i could possibly play with it to see if it work. I would have 2 controllers to play the pong game to play with a friend or a family memeber and have a screen that would show the game being played. i see that this would be cool and fun project to do like the constructing with the cables to the Arduino was not to hard and fun to make at the same time.
